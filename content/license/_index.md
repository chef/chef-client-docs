Chef Infra Client 19 requires a license to run. This document describes how to set a license and verify that it's accepted.

## Add a license

Chef Infra Client 19 has three ways to set a license:

- with an environment variable
- with a command line option
- with the command line interactive dialog

After setting a license key, Chef Infra Client validates it with Progress Chef's licensing service.

### Environment variable

- You can set the license key adding the `CHEF_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable:

  ```sh
  export CHEF_LICENSE_KEY=<LICENSE_KEY>
  ```

### Command line option

- You can set the license key using the `--chef-license-key` CLI option:

  ```sh
  chef-client --chef-license-key=<LICENSE_KEY>
  ```

### Interactive license dialog

If you run a `chef-client` command and a license key isn't already set, Chef Infra Client starts an interactive licensing dialog.

To set a license key with the CLI interactive dialog, follow these steps:

1. Verify the version of Chef Infra Client you have installed:

    ```sh
    chef-client --version
    ```

    It should return version 19.0.54 or greater for Infra Client RC 1.

1. Run `chef-client` in local mode and why-run mode:

    ```sh
    chef-client --local-mode --why-run
    ```

    Local mode runs Chef Infra Client on your local machine as if it were running against Chef Infra Server. why-run mode shows you what Chef Infra Client would configure if a Chef Infra Client run occurs.

1. At the first prompt, select **I already have a license ID**.

    ```text
    Please choose one of the options below (Press ↑/↓ arrow to move and Enter to select)
    ‣ I already have a license ID
      I don't have a license ID and would like to generate a new license ID
      Skip
    ```

1. Enter your license key at the second prompt.

    ```text
    Please enter your license ID:  <LICENSE_KEY>
    ✔ [Success] License validated successfully.
    ```

    After entering the license key, Chef Infra Client verifies your license and the run completes.
