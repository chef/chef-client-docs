The target node can be any remote system, edge device, or cloud resource that the host can reach. This includes edge devices, Wi-Fi routers, switches, relays, cloud resources, IP phones, router hubs, and network management peripherals.

## Supported platforms

Agentless Mode only executes on Linux nodes.

## Transport Interface (Train)

Agentless Mode uses [Transport Interface (Train)](https://github.com/inspec/train) to connect to nodes and execute Chef Infra Client runs.

Agentless Mode supports the SSH Train protocol. The other Train protocols are experimental.

## Requirements

Agentless Mode has the following requirements:

- A network-enabled system to execute Agentless Mode.
- The `chef-client` CLI. This is included with Chef Workstation.
- A [credentials file](#target-credentials-file) that provides the system with information to connect to a target node.
- A recipe that only includes [Agentless Mode-enabled resources](#resources).

## Target credentials file

The target credentials file defines the SSH connection settings for each node in TOML format.

Create a credentials file on the computer running Chef Workstation in `~/.chef/target_credentials`.

### Define node connections

Define connection settings for each node with an [inline table](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#inline-table).
For example, this adds credentials for three nodes:

```toml
['HOST-1']
host = 'target.system.host.1.com'
user = 'username'
sudo = true
key_files = '~/.keys/key-pair.pem'

['HOST-2']
host = 'target.system.host.2.com'
user = 'root'
password = '123456'

['192.168.0.252']
host = '192.168.0.252'
user = 'root'
password = '123456'

transport_protocol = 'ssh'
```

The following example includes all possible connection options for a single node:

```toml
# Set <TARGET_NAME> to a name for the target node. This could be the node IP address or FQDN.
['<TARGET_NAME>']

# ==== Target node connection settings ====
# host: The IP address or FQDN of a node. (Required)
# port: The port number of a node. Default is '22'
# ====

host = '<IP_ADDRESS OR FQDN>'
# port = '22'

# ==== User authentication settings ====
# user: The user used to connect to and execute Cookbooks on a node. Default is "root".
# sudo: If the user isn't root and you need to escalate privileges, set to true.
# key_files: If connecting with a secret key, the path to a secret key used to connect to a node.
# password: If connecting with a password, the password string to connect to a node.
# ====

# user = 'root'
# sudo = true
# key_files = '<PATH_TO_SECRET_FILE>'
# password = '<PASSWORD_STRING>'

# ==== Bastion host settings ====
# bastion_host: A bastion host to connect to the target through. Default is 'nil'.
# bastion_user: The bastion host user. Default is 'root'.
# bastion_port: The port to connect to the bastion host. Default is '22'.
# ====

# bastion_host = 'nil'
# bastion_user = 'root'
# bastion_port = '22'

# verify_host_key: Whether to verify the host key. Default is false
# verify_host_key = false

# forward_agent: Whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any) will be forwarded to the remote machine. Default is false.
# forward_agent = false

# transport_protocol: The protocol to use to connect to a node. Define this once for all nodes in the credentials file. Default value is 'ssh'.
transport_protocol = 'ssh'
```

### Node connection parameters

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD006 -->

Agentless Mode supports the following SSH connection parameters in a credentials file.

Common parameters:

`host`
: (Required) The IP address or FQDN of a node.

`port`

  Default value: `22`

`user`
: The user used to connect to and execute Cookbooks on a node. For example, `root`.

  Default value: `root`

`sudo`
: If the user isn't root and you need to escalate privileges, set to `true`.

`key_files`
: If connecting with a secret key, the path to a secret key used to connect to a node.

`password`
: If connecting with a password, the password string to connect to a node.

`transport_protocol`
: The protocol to use to connect to a node. Define this once for all nodes in the credentials file. Default value is `ssh`.

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD007 MD006 -->

### Retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault

You can configure Agentless Mode to fetch secrets from HashiCorp Vault.

In the `~/.chef/target_credentials` file, define the following:

- your Vault authentication settings with the `default_secrets_provider` hash
- your secret name saved in Vault

For example:

```toml
default_secrets_provider = {
  name = 'hashicorp-vault',
  endpoint = '<ENDPOINT>',
  token = '<VAULT_TOKEN>'
}

['<NODE_NAME>']
host = '<IP_ADDRESS_OR_FQDN>'
user = '<USERNAME>'
sudo = true
password = { secret = '<SECRET_NAME>', field = 'password' }
```

Replace:

- `<ENDPOINT>` with your Vault endpoint, for example: `http://127.0.0.1:8200`.
- `<VAULT_TOKEN>` with your Vault token, for example: `hvs.ewUEnIRVaKoBzs2...example...ewUEnIRVaKoBzs2`.
- `<SECRET_NAME>` with the name of the secret stored in Vault.

## Resources

All resources included in a Cookbook must be enabled in Agentless Mode to run in Agentless Mode.

See the list of [built-in Chef Infra resources](resources) that are supported in Agentless Mode.

### Custom resources

{{< readfile file="/reusable/md/agentless_custom_resource.md" >}}

For documentation on updating custom resources, see the [RC3 custom resources documentation](resources/custom).
For general guidelines on writing a custom resource, see the [custom resources documentation](https://docs.chef.io/custom_resources/).

#### Example

{{< readfile file="/reusable/md/agentless_custom_resource_example.md" >}}

## Run Agentless Mode

Run the `chef-client` executable using `-t` or `--target` to target a specific node. For example:

```sh
chef-client -t <TARGET_NAME>
```

Replace `<TARGET_NAME>` with the name of the host as defined in the credentials file.
For example, `HOST-1` in the [credential file example](#define-node-connections).

To execute a specific cookbook in Agentless Mode, run:

```sh
chef-client -t <TARGET_NAME> <PATH/TO/COOKBOOK/COOKBOOK_NAME>
```

Replace the following:

- `<TARGET_NAME>` with the name of the host as defined in the credentials file.
- `<PATH/TO/COOKBOOK/COOKBOOK_NAME>` with the path to the Cookbook on your system. For example, `/chef-repo/cookbooks/example_cookbook`. This runs the default recipe in the cookbook.

### Run Agentless Mode in Local Mode

You can run Agentless Mode in Local Mode.
Local Mode runs chef-zero locally as a lightweight instance of Chef Infra Server to execute a Client run on target nodes.

Use `-z` and `-t` to run Agentless Mode in Local Mode:

```sh
chef-client -z -t <TARGET_NAME>
```

You can also run a specific cookbook in Local Mode:

```sh
chef-client -z -t <TARGET_NAME> <RECIPE_FILE_PATH>
```

Replace:

- `<TARGET_NAME>` with the name of the host as defined in the credentials file.
  For example, `HOST-1` in the [credential file example](#define-node-connections).

- `<RECIPE_FILE_PATH>` with the recipe file path inside a cookbook. For example, `/chef-repo/cookbooks/cookbook1/recipe1.rb`.

You should see output similar to this:

```sh
Converging 1 resources
Recipe: @recipe_files::/root/.chef/chef-repo/cookbooks/cis_rhel_7_benchmark_v3.1.1/recipes/test2.rb
  * subversion[checkout_project_code] action sync (up to date)
Running handlers:
Running handlers complete
Infra Phase complete, 0/1 resources updated in 20 seconds
```

### Run Chef Agentless using Habitat

With `HAB_AUTH_TOKEN` exported and the license key available, run Chef Infra Client using Habitat:

```sh
hab pkg exec chef/chef-infra-client chef-client -z -t <TARGET_NODE> <PATH/TO/COOKBOOK/COOKBOOK_NAME>
```

Replace `<TARGET_NODE>` with the target name defined in the `target_credentials` file.

### Run Agentless Mode from Chef Infra Server

If you want to use cookbooks that are uploaded on Chef Infra Server define the node connection settings with your credentials file (`~/.chef/credentials`).

This uses Chef Infra Client and Knife:

- It makes it much easier to have a single settings file that Knife and Infra Client can both can use.
- When we call a `config.rb` file, the client automatically discovers and uses the `credentials` file, which contains our target node details.

The configure Agentless Mode to run on Chef Infra Server, follow these steps:

1. Define your node connection settings in the `credentials` file.

    **Note**: This configuration uses the [`credentials` file](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/knife_setup/), not the `target_credentials` file.

    ```sh
    # ~/.chef/credentials

    [default]
    client_name       = 'foo'
    client_key        = '/root/.chef/foo.pem'
    chef_server_url   = 'https://nodes.example.com/organizations/chef-org'

    ['<NODE_NAME>']
    host = '<IP_ADDRESS_OR_FQDN>'
    user = '<USERNAME>'
    sudo = true
    key_files = '~/.ssh/key-pair.pem'

    transport_protocol = 'ssh'
    ```

1. Update your [Knife `config.rb` file](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/config_rb/) so both Knife and Chef Infra Client can use it:

    ```ruby
    # Path to your Chef repository
    current_dir = File.dirname(__FILE__)

    # Logging
    log_level                :info
    log_location             STDOUT

    # User credentials
    node_name                "<CHEF_NODE_NAME>"   # Your Chef node
    client_key               "#{current_dir}/<PRIVATE_KEY_FILE>.pem"  # Path to your private key

    # Chef Server URL
    chef_server_url          "https://chef.example.com/organizations/org_name"

    # Cookbook path
    cookbook_path            ["#{current_dir}/../cookbooks"]

    # SSL verification (optional, often disabled in test setups)
    ssl_verify_mode          :verify_none
    ```

1. Verify your node is listed and update cookbooks as necessary:

    ```sh
    knife node list
    knife cookbook upload <COOKBOOK_NAME>
    knife node run_list add <NODE_NAME> 'recipe[<COOKBOOK>]'
    ```

1. Execute the cookbook you uploaded with Infra Client in Target Mode.

    Execute Infra Client using Chef Habitat:

    ```sh
    hab pkg exec chef/chef-infra-client chef-client -c ~/.chef/knife.rb -t Ubuntu_2404
    ```

    Execute Infra Client directly:

    ```sh
    chef-client -c ~/.chef/knife.rb -t Ubuntu_2404
    ```

### Schedule Agentless Mode on Chef Automate or Chef Infra Server

You can configure Chef Automate or Chef Infra Server to run Agentless Mode on a regular schedule.

Agentless Mode doesn't have a way to schedule Chef Infra Client runs on a node, but you can create a cron file that executes Agentless Mode on a regular schedule.

For example, this creates a cron file that executes Agentless Mode every thirty minutes:

```ruby
cat > /etc/cron.d/nodename.cron <<EOF
PATH="/opt/chefdk/bin:/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
GEM_ROOT="/opt/chefdk/embedded/lib/ruby/gems/2.6.0"

0,30 * * * * * chef-runner /usr/bin/chef-client -t <TARGET_NAME>
EOF
```

After the cron file is created, your node appears in Chef Infra Server or Chef Automate just like a regular node.

{{< note >}}

Use splay to reduce the load on a server that's executing many Client runs. You could use the `RANDOM_DELAY` variable (if your cron implementation features it) or set a random sleep offset as a prefix to your command. For example, with Ubuntu's num-utils package: `sleep $(numrandom 0..30)m`.

## Troubleshooting

The following are the common errors and their potential troubleshooting steps.

### `chef-client` execute error

Verify that the target node's hostname or IP address is correct, that the host is accessible using SSH, and that the user and password specified in the credentials file are correct.

### Custom resources don't execute

Verify that all resources have `target_mode` set to `true`. For example:

```ruby
provides :<RESOURCE_NAME>, target_mode: true
```

For more information, see the [custom resource example](#custom-resources).

### Ohai data doesn't report data from the target

Verify that Ohai can report data back by targeting the node:

```sh
ohai --target ssh://foobar.example.org/
```

Network latency can affect the ability of nodes to report data to Chef Infra Server.

If Ohai reports some data but not other data, it's a case of network latency.
Upgrade your infrastructure and network speed to receive all data as it's generated.
