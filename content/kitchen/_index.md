We've rebranded Test Kitchen, previously released as a component in Chef Workstation, as Chef Test Kitchen Enterprise, starting with version 1.0.0.
Test Kitchen Enterprise's repository is [chef/chef-test-kitchen-enterprise](https://github.com/chef/chef-test-kitchen-enterprise) and is a direct fork from the original community version.

This update emphasizes branding changes and supports passing licenses through to Chef Infra Client 19.
These modifications are implemented only in Chef Test Kitchen Enterprise and aren't backported to the community version of Test Kitchen.

The way that you run Test Kitchen Enterprise hasn't been altered.
The [community Test Kitchen documentation](https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/introduction/) and [Chef-hosted Test Kitchen documentation](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/kitchen/) are still accurate.

We anticipate adding additional drivers and features, which Chef will support, to Chef Test Kitchen Enterprise in future releases.
