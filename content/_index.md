To provide enterprise stability, Progress Chef has created a [Long Term Support (LTS) model](https://www.chef.io/blog/long-term-support-progress-chef-providing-stability) for products.
Chef Infra Client 19 is the first LTS version for infrastructure management and compliance mode.
This release---Release Candidate 2 (RC3)---is a preview for a limited audience to provide candid feedback on Chef Infra Client,
the new Infra Client migration tool, and updated Test Kitchen developer tools to ensure a seamless transition at the time of general availability (GA).

The new Chef Infra Client migration tool simplifies the transition from previous methods of installing and maintaining earlier versions of Infra Client to Chef Infra Client 19 release candidates and the final LTS version.

The new Test Kitchen Enterprise bundle is a fully Chef-maintained version of Test Kitchen that will be part of Chef Workstation at the time of release.

**Important:** Use Chef Infra Client 19 RC3 in non-production environments to verify existing deployment patterns and content against customer-specific infrastructure platforms.

## Supported environments

Chef Infra Client RC3 supports testing in non-production environments on Linux and Windows x86-64 systems.
Agentless Mode and Chef Workstation 26 RC3 are supported on Linux systems.

This release allows you to:

- Determine if the migration tool can upgrade your infrastructure to Chef Infra Client 19
- Gain familiarity with Habitat-based builds
- Prepare for new licensing requirements

## Key features

Chef Infra Client 19 has the following key features:

- **Long-term support (LTS):** Chef Infra Client 19 uses Habitat-based packaging instead of traditional omnibus builds.

- **Enhanced performance:** Chef InSpec resource packs will be modularized to improve performance.
