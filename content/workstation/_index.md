Start automating your infrastructure with Chef Workstation. It provides everything you need to get started with Chef, including ad hoc remote execution, remote scanning, configuration tasks, cookbook creation tools, and robust dependency and testing softwareâ€”all in one easy-to-install package.

With this release, we've changed how Chef Workstation is installed and licensed.

## Supported platforms

Chef Workstation is supported on Linux x86-64 systems.

## Install Chef Workstation

To install Chef Workstation, follow these steps:

1. If Chef Habitat isn't already installed on you system, download and install Chef Habitat:

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habitat-sh/habitat/main/components/hab/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -c stable
    ```

   For more information, see the [Chef Habitat install documentation](https://docs.chef.io/habitat/install_habitat/).

1. Verify Chef Habitat is installed.

    ```sh
    hab --version
    ```

1. If you haven't already configured Habitat, set up the `hab` CLI:

    ```sh
    hab cli setup
    ```

    Follow the prompts in the Habitat CLI.
    We recommend the following settings:

    - Connect to an on-premises Builder instance? [yes/No/quit] **No**
    - Set up a default origin? [Yes/no/quit] **No**
    - Set up a default Builder personal access token? [yes/No/quit] **No**
    - Set up a default Habitat Supervisor control gateway secret? [yes/No/quit] **No**

1. Install the Chef Workstation Habitat package:

    ```sh
    sudo hab pkg install --binlink --force chef/chef-development-kit-enterprise --channel unstable
    ```

1. Optional: Verify that Chef Workstation and its tools are installed:

    Chef Workstation returns a list of installed packages and their versions.

## Chef Workstation tools

Chef Workstation includes the following tools:

- Berkshelf
- `chef-cli` CLI
- Chef Infra Client 19

These tools come bundled with Chef Workstation, however you can install them separately using the `hab pkg install` command.
