    Use the **package** resource to manage packages. When the package is installed from a local file (such as with RubyGems, dpkg, or RPM Package Manager), the file must be added to the node using the remote_file or cookbook_file resources.

    This resource is the base resource for several other resources used for package management on specific platforms. While it is possible to use each of these specific resources, we recommend using the **package** resource as often as possible.

  A **package** resource block manages a package on a node, typically by
  installing it. The simplest use of the **package** resource is:

  ```ruby
  package 'httpd'
  ```

  which will install Apache using all of the default options and the
  default action (`:install`).

  For a package that has different package names, depending on the
  platform, use a `case` statement within the **package**:

  ```ruby
  package 'Install Apache' do
    case node[:platform]
    when 'redhat',
   'centos'
      package_name 'httpd'
    when 'ubuntu', 'debian'
      package_name
   'apache2'
    end
  end
  ```

examples: |
  **Install a gems file for use in recipes**

  ```ruby
  chef_gem 'right_aws' do
    action :install
  end

  require 'right_aws'
  ```


  **Install a gems file from the local file system**

  ```ruby
  gem_package 'right_aws' do
    source '/tmp/right_aws-1.11.0.gem'
    action :install
  end
  ```

  **Install a package**

  ```ruby
  package 'tar' do
    action :install
  end
  ```

  **Install a package version**

  ```ruby
  package 'tar' do

    version '1.16.1-1'
    action :install
  end
  ```

  **Install a package with options**

  ```ruby
  package 'debian-archive-keyring' do
    action :install
    options '--force-yes'
  end
  ```

  **Install a package with a response_file**

  Use of a `response_file` is only supported on Debian and Ubuntu at this
  time. Custom resources must be written to support the use of a
  `response_file`, which contains debconf answers to questions normally
  asked by the package manager on installation. Put the file in
  `/files/default` of the cookbook where the package is specified and Chef
  Infra Client will use the **cookbook_file** resource to retrieve it.

  To install a package with a `response_file`:

  ```ruby
  package 'sun-java6-jdk' do
    response_file 'java.seed'
  end
  ```

  **Install a specified architecture using a named provider**

  ```ruby
  yum_package 'glibc-devel' do
    arch 'i386'
  end
  ```

  **Purge a package**

  ```ruby
  package 'tar' do
    action :purge
  end
  ```

  **Remove a package**

  ```ruby
  package 'tar' do
    action :remove
  end
  ```

  **Upgrade a package**

  ```ruby
  package 'tar' do
    action :upgrade
  end
  ```

  **Use the `ignore_failure` common attribute**

  ```ruby
  gem_package 'syntax' do
    action :install
    ignore_failure true
  end
  ```

  **Avoid unnecessary string interpolation**

  Do this:

  ```ruby
  package 'mysql-server' do
    version node['mysql']['version']
    action :install
  end
  ```

  and not this:

  ```ruby
  package 'mysql-server' do
    version "#{node['mysql']['version']}"
    action :install
  end

  ```

  **Install a package in a platform**

  The following example shows how
  to use the **package** resource to
  install an application named `app` and ensure
  that the correct packages
  are installed for the correct platform:

  ```ruby
  package 'app_name' do
    action :install
  end

  case node[:platform]

  when 'ubuntu','debian'
    package 'app_name-doc' do
      action :install
    end
  when 'centos'
    package 'app_name-html' do
      action :install
    end
  end
  ```

  **Install sudo, then configure /etc/sudoers/ file**

  The following example shows how to install sudo and then configure the
  `/etc/sudoers` file:

  ```ruby
  # the following code sample comes from the ``default``
  # recipe in the ``sudo`` cookbook: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/sudo

  package 'sudo' do
    action :install
  end

  if node['authorization']['sudo']['include_sudoers_d']
    directory '/etc/sudoers.d' do
      mode        '0755'
      owner       'root'
      group       'root'
      action      :create
    end

    cookbook_file '/etc/sudoers.d/README' do
      source      'README'
      mode        '0440'
      owner       'root'
      group       'root'
      action      :create
    end
  end

  template '/etc/sudoers' do
    source 'sudoers.erb'
    mode '0440'
    owner 'root'
    group platform?('freebsd') ? 'wheel' : 'root'
    variables(
      :sudoers_groups => node['authorization']['sudo']['groups'],
      :sudoers_users => node['authorization']['sudo']['users'],
      :passwordless => node['authorization']['sudo']['passwordless']
    )
  end
  ```

  where:

  - the **package** resource is used to install sudo
  - the `if` statement is used to ensure availability of the `/etc/sudoers.d` directory
  - the **template** resource tells Chef Infra Client where to find the `sudoers` template
  - the `variables` property is a hash that passes values to template
    files (that are located in the `templates/` directory for the cookbook

  **Use a case statement to specify the platform**

  The following example shows how to use a case statement to tell Chef
  Infra Client which platforms and packages to install using cURL.

  ```ruby
  package 'curl'
    case node[:platform]
    when 'redhat', 'centos'
      package 'package_1'
      package 'package_2'
      package 'package_3'
    when 'ubuntu', 'debian'
      package 'package_a'
      package 'package_b'
      package 'package_c'
    end
  end
  ```

  where `node[:platform]` for each node is identified by Ohai during every Chef
  Infra Client run. For example:

  ```ruby
  package 'curl'
    case node[:platform]
    when 'redhat', 'centos'
      package 'zlib-devel'
      package 'openssl-devel'
      package 'libc6-dev'
    when 'ubuntu', 'debian'
      package 'openssl'
      package 'pkg-config'
      package 'subversion'
    end
  end
  ```

  **Use symbols to reference attributes**

  Symbols may be used to reference attributes:

  ```ruby
  package 'mysql-server' do
    version node[:mysql][:version]
    action :install
  end
  ```

  instead of strings:

  ```ruby
  package 'mysql-server' do
    version node['mysql']['version']
    action :install
  end
  ```

  **Use a whitespace array to simplify a recipe**

  The following examples show different ways of doing the same thing. The
  first shows a series of packages that will be upgraded:

  ```ruby
  package 'package-a' do
    action :upgrade
  end

  package 'package-b' do
    action :upgrade
  end

  package 'package-c' do
    action :upgrade
  end

  package 'package-d' do
    action :upgrade
  end
  ```

  and the next uses a single **package** resource and a whitespace array (`%w`):

  ```ruby
  package %w{package-a package-b package-c package-d} do
    action :upgrade
  end
  ```

  **Specify the Homebrew user with a UUID**

  ```ruby
  homebrew_package 'emacs' do
    homebrew_user 1001
  end
  ```

  **Specify the Homebrew user with a string**

  ```ruby
  homebrew_package 'vim' do
    homebrew_user 'user1'
  end
  ```
